# My Personal Website, [sinaatalay.com](https://sinaatalay.com)

I have been creating websites since I was nine years old. I always coded my previous websites from scratch. Now, I realize the value of using existing tools.

This website is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), an open-source scientific and technical publishing system.

All the content is written with Quarto's flavored markdown syntax, which can be rendered into HTML, PDF, and many other formats. It supports $\LaTeX$-like features such as cross-referencing, footnotes, citations with Biblatex, etc.

I was inspired to create a Quarto website after reading a blog post, "[*Writing technical papers with Markdown and Pandoc*](https://kdheepak.com/blog/writing-papers-with-markdown/)" by Dheepak Krishnamurthy. He created his website with Quarto as well.
