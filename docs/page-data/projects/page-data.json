The constraints and targets of the design are specified precisely. The electric dynamometer with a dynamic braking system is chosen for the design, and alternative options are discussed. The system is formalized, and the design variables are adjusted to achieve our targets bound to our constraints. The reasons behind the decisions are explained. The measurement system is explained thoroughly. The dynamometer is modeled, and the PID control scheme's closed-loop response is simulated with MATLAB. The MATLAB codes are published to Github.","date":"Spring 2022","title":"Design of a Dynamometer","slug":"design-of-a-dynamometer","author":"Sina Atalay, Arda Gençgel, and Hümeyra Kayadibi","shortAbstract":"This report covers the design of an absorption dynamometer for a small DC motor that will be constructed in Fall 2022 and used at Bogazici University's mechanical engineering laboratories."},"id":"1503eec2-9a52-57ea-80cb-16a442d4a8f5"},{"frontmatter":{"abstract":"Lorem ninja ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.
